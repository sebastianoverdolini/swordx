Monkey Island is a series of adventure games. The first four games in the series were produced and 
published by LucasArts, formerly known as Lucasfilm Games. The fifth installment of the franchise was developed by 
Telltale Games in collaboration with LucasArts. The games follow the misadventures of the hapless Guybrush Threepwood as he struggles 
to become the most notorious pirate in the Caribbean, defeat the plans of the evil undead pirate LeChuck and win the 
heart of governess Elaine Marley. Each game's plot usually involves the mysterious Monkey Island and its impenetrable secrets.

The first game in the series was created as a collaborative effort among Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer and Dave 
Grossman. Gilbert worked on the first two games before leaving LucasArts. Grossman and Schafer, who also worked on
 the first two games, would enjoy success on other games before they both left LucasArts. The rights to Monkey Island remained 
 with LucasArts, and the third and fourth games were created without direct involvement from the original writing staff. Dave Grossman was the 
 project leader of the fifth game in the series and Ron Gilbert was involved with the first design of the game.
