Albert Reiss (22 February 1870 – 19 June 1940) was a
German operatic tenor who had a prolific career
in Europe and the United States during the first third of the twentieth century.
He spent much of his career performing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City where he sang in more
than 1,000 performances, including several premieres, between 1901 and 1919. Excelling in the tenor buffo repertoire,
Reiss was particularly associated with the roles of David in Richard Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg and Mime in Der Ring des Nibelungen,
two roles he sang in numerous houses internationally.
