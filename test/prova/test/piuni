The American video game developer Firaxis Games has worked on 22 games since 1996, 12 of which are part of the Civilization
 series. Firaxis Games was founded in May 1996 by Sid Meier, Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds as Firaxis Software, following their 
 departure from MicroProse, which Meier had co-founded. The company was renamed to Firaxis Games in July 1997 prior to releasing any titles. 
 It produced seven games primarily for Microsoft Windows personal computers over the next nine years through multiple publishers; 
 these games include wargames such as their first title, Sid Meier's Gettysburg! (1997), and 4X turn-based strategy games. Three of the games were 
 part of the company's flagship Civilization series of 4X games, which was originally begun by Meier at MicroProse. Since being acquired by Take-Two I
 nteractive in 2005, Firaxis has released nine further titles 
related to the Civilization series, primarily 4X games. Firaxis's most recent title is Civilization V
