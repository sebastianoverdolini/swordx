Edward Bruce, younger brother of Robert the Bruce, was named heir to the throne but he died without legitimate children on 
3 December 1318 in a battle near Dundalk in Ireland. Marjorie by this time had died in a riding accident â€“ probably in 1317. 
Parliament decreed her infant son, Robert Stewart, as heir presumptive, but this lapsed on 5 March 1324 on the birth of a son,
 David, to King Robert and his second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh. Robert Stewart inherited the title of High Steward of Scotland on his 
 father's death on 9 April 1326, and a Parliament held in July 1326 confirmed the young Steward as heir should Prince David die without a successor. 
 In 1329 King 
Robert I died and the six-year-old David succeeded to the
 throne with Sir Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray appointed 
 Guardian of Scotland.
